Flashing orange (red and green) or alternating (red xor green), is a 
matter of timing.  The flash cycle is something less than 1 Hz and 
without exact timing it would be difficult to change the flash mode
without resetting it.  If the flash mode for the second LED is
started while the first LED is lit or it is started combined (by adding 
0x04 and 0x08), the light will be combined.  If the second LED is lit 
during the off cycle of the first LED, it will be alternating.

Once the flash mode for an LED has been started, it must be set to a 
different state before it can be reset to a different cycle.
